# A*-algorithm-Visualization
A python project to visualize how A* algorithm works for pathfinding work case. Other algorithms can be implemented on the same basis

The A* (A star) algorithm is widely used in various applications, including maps and games, to find the shortest path between a start and end point, even when obstacles are present.

This particular project is implemented in Python3 using the PyGame library. The canvas is represented as a grid composed of small boxes or cubes, which can serve as the starting point, end point, or obstructions.

To calculate the shortest path, the algorithm considers three parameters:

F score: This is the sum of the G score and H score.
The G score represents the movement cost from the starting point to a specific box on the grid. 
The H score is an estimate of the movement cost from a given box to the final (end) point on the grid. The H score is referred to as a heuristic because it provides an approximate "smart" guess without considering any obstructions.

These parameters are updated in an open set, and the algorithm continues until the set is empty. At each step, the algorithm selects the smallest route by popping the parameters from the set.

Further details and implementation steps can be found in the included .py file, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing the A* algorithm in the context of grid-based pathfinding using Python and PyGame.
